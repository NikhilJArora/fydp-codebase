The FYDP (Fourth Year Design Project) is targeted towards attempting to build an image-based sensor for determining parking lot occupancy.  Using a camera enables us determine occupancy of multiple spots per sensor node and overall reduce the costs of determining occupancy within a parking-lot.

## What the codebase contains?
This codebase contains the image processing and the motor control code.  

## Image Processing:

* details related to image processing and motor control coming soon...
