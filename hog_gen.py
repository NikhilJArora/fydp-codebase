"""
Creating the training set.
 - grab images from working dir
 - create container dataframe to store data
 - config our HOG descriptor from our config settings
 - for each image:
    - greyscale the image
    - resize the image .resize(im, (200,100))
    - compute the hog of the image
    - write last col as the label
- write out the pandas dataframe to a csv
 - Compute hog dataset for images
